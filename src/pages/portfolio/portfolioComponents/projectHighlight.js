        description: "What started out initially as a two-dimensional fantasy map generator quickly became a much larger project than I anticipated. This procedural landmass generator features a small range of options to dictate how you want your landmass developed, in either 2D or 3D. This project remains incomplete, in my opinion, due to it not being at a place that I would have liked it to be. Nonetheless, it is a piece of software in its own right that accomplishes its goal. <br><br> This project was created in Unity so its all coded in C#. It uses noise calculations to create a noise map and generate values for each 'tile'. I would like to recreate this project in the future when my skills have developed further in order to better optimise it and allow it to have more generation options. <br><br> More information can be found on the GitHub repository linked with the github image.",

Many sub-projects were developed, the majority of which only to a superficial level that showcases the intended combination but without needless further development. The sub-projects would be evaluated after development and compared to others to decide whether it should proceed into further development. The end result was the best sub-project being taken into full development and turned into a playable video game. <br><br> More information can be found on the GitHub Repo.",
