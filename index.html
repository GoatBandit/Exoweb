                                    Hello, I'm Connor Easterbrook, though I am better known through my professional
                                    online identification, GoatBandit.<br><br>

                                    I've found my ideal career.<br><br>

                                    Growing up, I never truly knew what I wanted to do. Growing up with three older
                                    brothers showed me that the correct career will eventually find its way on my path.
                                    Well, it has. It almost seems obvious at this point, growing up playing video games,
                                    using apps, wondering how they were created. Suddenly I am one of those magicians
                                    that fourteen year old me only read about.<br><br>

                                    Funnily enough, it all began with an app released in 2013 called 'Flappy Bird.' It
                                    became a popular craze for a few months and then fizzled out as kids moved on to
                                    other things. Six years later in 2019, I stumbled across a game development tutorial
                                    for a Flappy Bird clone. One week later and I had a clone of this game I spent many
                                    hours on when I was a teenager. I saw its flaws and rough edges and realised that
                                    there was a lot of room to grow. It has all been up from there, to be approaching
                                    the end of my BSc in Games Technology.<br><br>

                                    I love learning new ways further evolve my programming and seeing how the end
                                    product is always more polished than my previous one, taking notes on what can be
                                    improved in the future. My specialities include adaptability to learning new skills and programming languages quickly, problem-solving, responsive design principles, website
                                    optimization, communication, and source control.
